    "# Analysis of App Profiles for Profit\n",

Considering that we want to build apps that are free to download and install, the main revenue source consists of in-app ads. Hence, the amount of users downloading the app and using it, is what matters in terms of profit. Hence, for making profitable apps, we need to analyse data for looking the category of apps in which most users are interested in.`\n",
